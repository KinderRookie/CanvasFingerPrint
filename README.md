# CanvasFingerPrint


## Overview
Canvas fingerprinting is a technique used to uniquely identify and track visitors to a website without the use of cookies. By utilizing the HTML5 canvas element, websites can generate a unique fingerprint based on how a user's browser renders graphical content. This method exploits the subtle differences in graphics processing across devices to create a consistent and trackable identifier.

This project is a collaborative effort with Professor Chris Hamamoto from Seoul National University. It aims to demonstrate how web content distributors can collect information through the rendering of graphical objects using canvas fingerprinting techniques.

## Collaboration
This project is developed in collaboration with:
- **Professor Chris Hamamoto**
  - Faculty of Design
  - Seoul National University

The goal is to explore and elucidate the implications of privacy and tracking technologies in modern web environments.

## Technical Specifications
- **Python Version**: 3.10
- **Library Used**: Pygame
  - Pygame is utilized here for its capability to manage graphics and render simulations that mimic the canvas fingerprinting process.

## Installation
To get started with this project, ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your machine. Then, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/KinderRookie/CanvasFingerPrint.git](https://github.com/KinderRookie/CanvasFingerPrint.git)
cd CanvasFingerPrint
pip install pygame
